My goal is to learn how to implement the K-Nearest-Neighbor with US.President 1976 - 2016 elections database from: <br> 

https://electionlab.mit.edu/data

"This data file contains constituency (state-level) returns for elections to the U.S. presidency from 1976 to 2016."

I'm trying to determine who would be the president in each specific year according to votes and electoral college number of votes. I would also add the differenes between electoral votes and the total votes from each state.
